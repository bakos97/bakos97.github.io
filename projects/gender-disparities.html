          Our journey takes us through bustling streets and serene landscapes as we unravel the narrative
          of gender disparities in income, parental leave, and education. This tale is multi-faceted,
          touching upon income, parental leave, and education.

      <!-- Income Disparities -->
      <h2>The Heart of the Matter: Income Disparities</h2>

      <img src="../income_gap_comparison.png" alt="Income Gap between Genders in Copenhagen and All Denmark (2009-2021)" />

      <p>
        This line chart presents a stark contrast in the income gap between genders in Copenhagen and the
        rest of Denmark over the years. Interestingly, the capital city appears to have a smaller income
        gap compared to the national average, though the gap has been slowly increasing in both areas
        over the years.
      </p>
      <p>Next, we zoom into the districts within Denmark, examining the disparities at a more granular level.</p>

      <h3>Interactive plot of gender disparities in income in Denmark over the years</h3>
      <iframe src="../income_interactive.html" width="100%" height="575" title="Interactive income disparity chart"></iframe>

      <p>
        This interactive plot reveals the stark disparities between male and female income across all
        districts in Denmark. Notice the pronounced gap in wealthier districts like Gentofte, Hørsholm,
        and Rudersdal. These areas, with their high average incomes, harbor larger gender pay gaps,
        hinting at a trend of higher income disparities in wealthier districts.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our analysis shows, income disparities between genders exist in Copenhagen as well as other
        parts of Denmark. This observation is echoed by general insights provided by
        <a href="https://denmark.dk/society-and-business/gender-equality">Denmark.dk</a>, which
        acknowledges the existence of a gender pay gap in Denmark despite the country's strong performance
        in gender equality.
      </p>

      <h3>A Geographic Perspective: Visualising Disparities Across Denmark</h3>
      <iframe src="../income_map.html" width="100%" height="500" title="Map of income gap by area in Denmark"></iframe>
      <p>
        This map plot illustrates the income gap across various regions in Denmark from 2009 to 2021.
        While the gap in some regions has remained relatively stable, in others it has fluctuated,
        indicating that gender income disparities are widespread and vary across regions.
      </p>

      <!-- Parental Leave -->
      <h2>Parental Leave</h2>

      <p>
        Now we want to take a dive into parental leave in Copenhagen and compare it to other locations
        in Denmark. Also, we want to explore how parental leave could possibly correlate to education
        and income.
      </p>

      <img src="../parental_gap_line_plot.png" alt="Development of gap in parental leave in Copenhagen compared to All Denmark" />

      <p>
        For all of Denmark the gap was bigger in 2021 than it was in 2015, while in Copenhagen it's the
        opposite. It is interesting that the gap seems to be getting bigger in all of Denmark, since over
        the recent years equality between genders has been a subject of many conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though parental leave in Denmark is quite good, the rights between men and women were not
        the same. Before, with children born before August 2022, women received paid leave for four weeks
        before the birth of a child and 14 weeks after, while men received paid leave for two weeks after
        the birth. Then the parents split up to 32 weeks of paid leave, as provided by
        <a href="https://denmark.dk/society-and-business/equality">Denmark.dk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now new rules have been accepted in Denmark for parental leave that took effect in August 2022.
        Each parent has an earmarked 11 weeks for parental leave and these weeks cannot be shared between
        parents. See article on the subject by
        <a href="https://www.thelocal.dk/20211026/denmark-agrees-new-rules-for-parental-leave">thelocal.dk</a>.
      </p>

      <img src="../parental_gap_worst_cph.png" alt="Parental leave days comparison between Copenhagen, Ishøj and All Denmark" />

      <p>
        Looking at the graph for Ishøj, it's very interesting to see how the parental leave for women
        is trending upwards.
      </p>

      <h3>Parental Leave &amp; Education</h3>
      <img src="../parental_gap_education.png" alt="Average parental leave days for fathers compared to their education" />
      <p>
        Generally, fathers with higher levels of education tend to take longer parental leaves.
      </p>

      <!-- Education -->
      <h2>Education</h2>

      <img src="../masters_education.png" alt="Men and women aged 30-34 who finished masters in Copenhagen vs Denmark" />
      <p>
        From 2005 to 2022, there has been a steady increase in the number of individuals pursuing higher
        education among both men and women. A noteworthy observation is the widening gender gap in
        education, favouring women. This trend becomes especially noticeable when examining the
        percentages, despite the income gap favouring men.
      </p>

      <img src="../gender_education2.png" alt="Education level comparison between genders in 2005 and 2022" />
      <p>
        Upon closer examination, regardless of gender, there has been an increase of individuals seeking
        higher levels of education in Denmark. The categories that had a decrease were "Not Stated" and
        "Primary Education", which is a positive indication. Every education level above "H50" has seen a
        rise, indicating a growing trend of people seeking higher education in Denmark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on findings from
        <a href="https://politiken.dk/indland/uddannelse/art9287557/">Politiken</a>, the gender disparity
        in higher education was less distinct four decades ago. The current situation shows a significant
        increase in the disparity, favouring women.
      </p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Our exploration of gender disparities in income, parental leave, and education in Copenhagen and
        Denmark has revealed important findings. We found a persistent income gap between genders, with
        wealthier areas exhibiting larger pay gaps. Parental leave has been a crucial contributing factor,
        as women have traditionally taken longer leaves. However, recent policy changes are working toward
        making parental leave more equal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In education, more women than men are pursuing higher degrees — yet the income gap persists.
        Factors such as occupational choices, parental leave differences, and work patterns all contribute.
        Although progress has been made, there is still work to be done to achieve true gender equality.
