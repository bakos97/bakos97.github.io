# Unveiling Gender Disparities: A Tale of Copenhagen and Denmark

Our journey takes us through bustling streets and serene landscapes as we unravel the narrative of gender disparities in income, parental leave, and education. This tale is multi-faceted, touching upon income, parental leave, and education.

## The Heart of the Matter: Income Disparities

This line chart presents a stark contrast in the income gap between genders in Copenhagen and the rest of Denmark over the years. Interestingly, the capital city appears to have a smaller income gap compared to the national average, though the gap has been slowly increasing in both areas over the years.

Next, we zoom into the districts within Denmark, examining the disparities at a more granular level.

This interactive plot reveals the stark disparities between male and female income across all districts in Denmark. Notice the pronounced gap in wealthier districts like Gentofte, Hørsholm, and Rudersdal. These areas, with their high average incomes, harbor larger gender pay gaps, hinting at a trend of higher income disparities in wealthier districts. As our analysis shows, income disparities between genders exist in Copenhagen as well as other parts of Denmark. This observation is echoed by general insights provided by [Denmark.dk](https://denmark.dk/society-and-business/gender-equality), which acknowledges the existence of a gender pay gap in Denmark despite the country's strong performance in gender equality. Moreover, the underrepresentation of women in top management positions, as highlighted by Denmark.dk, could potentially contribute to this wage gap, as such positions often command higher salaries.


### A Geographic Perspective: Visualizing Disparities Across Denmark

With the help of geographic visualization, we can get a clearer picture of how these disparities are distributed across Denmark.

This map plot illustrates the income gap across various regions in Denmark from 2009 to 2021. While the gap in some regions has remained relatively stable, in others it has fluctuated, indicating that gender income disparities are widespread and vary across regions.

The Next Steps
We've uncovered the income disparities between genders in Copenhagen and Denmark, but our journey is far from over. We now turn our attention towards the issue of parental leave. How does this key aspect of life contribute to the gender disparities we observe? Or should we delve into education, another critical facet of our society? Whichever path we choose, there's much more to uncover and understand.


## Parental Leave

In the above graph we can see how over the years the gap is becoming bigger for the average of all of Denmark compared to how Copenhagen is developing into a smaller gap in the recent years. For all of Denmark the gap was bigger in 2021 then it was in 2015 while in Copenhagen the gap is smaller in 2021 than it was in 2015. It's also interesting to see how the gap is smaller in Copenhagen compared to all of Denmark. Which tells us that the equality in paternal leave in Copenhagen is better compared to all of Denmark and it's developing in the right direction, even though it's happening slowly.

Even though the parental leave in Denmark is quite generous, the rights between men and women were not the same. Before, with children that are born before August 2022, women recieved paid leave for four weeks before the birth of a child and 14 weeks after. While men received paid leave for two weeks after the birth. Then the parents split up to 32 weeks of paid leave (https://denmark.dk/society-and-business/equality#:~:text=Did%20you%20know,to%2032%20weeks%20paid%20leave.).

But looking at the data it seems that this split of 32 weeks mostly was taken by the women. Which in the past it was very 'normal' for the women to take most of the parental leave. This was explained away with that it was the obvious choice since men are the ones that earn more and it would cost the household more to have the men on parental leave. 

Now new rules have been accepted in Denmark for parental leave that took effect in August 2022. Where each parent has an earmarked 11 weeks for parental leave and these weeks cannot be shared between parents. But this is higher than the average has been for men ever in Copenhagen (https://www.thelocal.dk/20211026/denmark-agrees-new-rules-for-parental-leave). It will be very interesting to see how these numbers change since the new rules took place. 

The top three locations that have the highest income gaps are ranking number 77, 98 and 101 on the list of areas sorted by parental leave gap. While the bottom three with the lowest income gaps rank number 110, 88 and 85 on that same list for parental leave gap. Which maybe does not tell us a lot, but from those numbers alone there does not seem to be correlation between the income gap and parental leave gap. 


Copenhagen is 106 in the list of areas sorted by parental leave gap.
The areas that have the most gap between genders when it comes to parental leave are: ['Ishøj', 'Lemvig', 'Greve']
The areas that have the least gap are: ['Frederiksberg', 'Kalundborg', 'Lolland']

## Education
