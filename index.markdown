# COVID-19's Impact on San Francisco's Crime Rates: A Comprehensive Analysis

## How the Pandemic Affected Crime Patterns in San Francisco from 2018-2021

San Francisco, the city by the bay, is known for its vibrant culture, picturesque landscapes, and booming economy. However, like any major city, it has its fair share of crime. With the arrival of COVID-19, the pandemic has had a significant impact on the city, disrupting the status quo in almost every aspect of daily life. In this piece, we explore the fascinating world of crime in San Francisco during the pandemic and its effects on public safety in the city.

According to our analysis of the SF Crime Data, San Francisco witnessed over 133,262 reported incidents annually on average. Between 2018 and 2019, the city saw around 148,250 reported incidents per year, but this number dropped to around 118,273 in 2020 and 2021, representing a significant decline of nearly 20.22%.

Delving deeper into the data, we find that the pandemic has had an unequal impact on different categories of crime. Some types of crime decreased significantly, while others stubbornly remained high or even increased. The bar chart below illustrates the categories that saw the greatest changes in average count during the pandemic."

  <figcaption>This bar chart shows the incident categories with the greatest change in average count during the pandemic in San Francisco. The categories are ranked by percentage change, with the largest positive and negative changes at the top and bottom, respectively. The incident category "Civil Sidewalks" had the greatest negative change, with an average count decrease of 92.42% during the pandemic compared to the 2018-2019 period. The incident category "Vandalism" had the greatest positive change, with an average count increase of 66.67% during the pandemic compared to the 2018-2019 period.</figcaption>

During the pandemic, vandalism increased dramatically by 66.67%, probably as a result of the closure of public places and companies, which may have made them more susceptible to property destruction. A considerable surge of over 40% was also seen in burglaries and car theft.

The epidemic had a significant favorable effect on civil walkways, which saw a 92.42% drop. Prostitution, alcohol laws, and gambling all saw declines of more than 60%.

But what about vandalism in various SF neighborhoods? We created a map to display the quantity of vandalism occurrences that occurred in each district between 2018 and 2020. Lighter colors denote more events, and the colors themselves represent the number of incidents. The video is below.

As you can see, there were an increases in vandalism incidents in almost all districts during the pandemic. The central district saw the most significant increase, going from 23 incidents to 42 incidents. The northern district also had a significant increase, going from 28 incidents to 53 incidents. Richmond district saw a increase in vandalism incidents, going from 7 incidents to 16 incidents.

As we delved deeper into our analysis of San Francisco's crime patterns during the pandemic, we noticed a significant increase in vandalism. This increase in vandalism was perplexing to us, and we wanted to learn more about the phenomenon. We stumbled upon an article in the San Francisco Chronicle from April 2020, which shed some light on the issue.

The article reported that break-ins and instances of vandalism at restaurants were becoming increasingly common during the pandemic, as the Bay Area sheltered in place. While burglary rates were down by single digits in San Francisco compared to the same period the previous year, the combination of less-guarded businesses and unusually empty streets had created conditions for desperate people or opportunists to burglarize restaurants.

Mark Bechelli, the owner of Bechelli's Flower Market Cafe, discovered a busted window at his San Francisco restaurant about a week after the shelter-in-place order went into effect. Security footage revealed that a man had squeezed into the restaurant, swiped some liquor and quickly got out. Given the back-to-back break-ins, Bechelli reinforced the window with wood beams and hasn’t had a problem since. Both burglars stole liquor, leaving the back of the bar empty. Bechelli estimates losing $3,000 between the window and alcohol.

Similarly, Little Skillet, a San Francisco soul food spot, had long relied on takeout and remained open throughout the shelter-in-place order. On Saturday, owner Deanna Sison arrived to find the locks broken and valuables such as iPads, speakers, and cash gone.

As time went on, people became more and more desperate and took bigger and bigger risks, said Jay Foster, the former partner of Sison. He thought that restaurants that were still operating were bigger targets during the shutdown because they’re more likely to have cash and inventory.

This article confirms our finding that vandalism has increased during the pandemic in San Francisco, and offers insight into the reasons why. It also highlights the struggles of local businesses during this challenging time. We believe by understanding the impact of corona on crime in San Francisco, we can help support the community in moving forward.

The Bokeh visualization we've created provides a compelling look at the impact of the pandemic on crime rates in San Francisco. By mapping out the daily count of new COVID-19 cases alongside the number of reported crimes in various categories, such as Larceny Theft, Assault, Vandalism, Burglary, and Motor Vehicle Theft, we can see how crime patterns have changed over time. The plot also highlights the primary types of crime that occur in the city, which makes it easier for us to understand how crime and the epidemic are related.

One of the main conclusions from this visualization is that there is no doubt that the epidemic has had an effect on San Francisco's crime statistics. We observe a decline in reported crimes as the COVID-19 cases increased. The crime rate does not, however, steadily go down over time. Instead, it begins to decline as the number of corona cases peaks.
Overall, this interactive visualization provides valuable insights into the changing dynamics of crime patterns in San Francisco during the pandemic. By understanding these changes, we can work together to ensure that our community remains a safe and vibrant place to live and work.
## Conclusion
The COVID-19 epidemic has significantly altered San Francisco's crime patterns, with some types of crime declining while others, particularly vandalism, are on the rise. The world has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, and San Francisco has not been spared. As we've seen, the city's crime patterns have been drastically altered. The relationship between San Francisco's crime rates and the pandemic's timeframe will be investigated in this section using an interactive Bokeh display.

For residents and decision-makers in San Francisco, COVID-19 and crime have been two crucial issues. Over the course of this narrative, we look into how these two issues connect. Using data from the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Francisco Police Department, we can compare the number of new COVID-19 cases with the daily count of various crime types.

One of the many changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic is how it has affected San Francisco's crime trends. While some types of crime reduced during the pandemic, others, including vandalism, greatly increased. Yet, based on our data, these vandalism occurrences are not common over time, and it's possible that the closure of businesses and public areas has contributed to their increase during the pandemic.

We developed an interactive Bokeh visualization to investigate the relationship between the pandemic and crime rates in San Francisco. It highlights the direct influence of the pandemic on public safety by demonstrating a clear connection between the timing of the pandemic and crime rates. Policymakers can utilize this data to pinpoint areas that want more attention and funding.

Our research also sheds light on the difficulties faced by neighborhood businesses during the pandemic. The conclusions drawn from this analysis can aid in generating awareness of their plight and assistance for them during these trying times.

It is vital to continue to pay close attention to public safety in our communities as we manage the pandemic's repercussions. We can cooperate to make sure that San Francisco continues to be a secure and prosperous environment for all of its citizens and workers by utilizing the facts and insights discovered via this investigation.
