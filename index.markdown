# Crime in the Time of COVID-19: How the Pandemic Changed San Francisco's Criminal Landscape

## An Analysis of How COVID-19 Has Impacted Crime Rates in San Francisco

San Francisco is known for its vibrant culture, picturesque landscapes, and thriving economy. However, like any major city, San Francisco has also experienced its share of crime over the years. In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the city, affecting everything from public health to the local economy. But how has the pandemic impacted crime in San Francisco? To answer this question, we turned to the SF Crime Data, a comprehensive dataset that tracks crime patterns in the city over time. In this story, we explore the insights we gained from analyzing the data, focusing on the ways in which the pandemic has affected crime in San Francisco. From changes in overall crime trends to shifts in the types of crimes being committed, we uncover the impact of the pandemic on public safety in the city. Join us as we explore the fascinating world of crime in San Francisco during the pandemic.

Despite the significant changes in crime patterns during the pandemic, it is important to note that San Francisco has seen a general decline in crime rates over the past few years. According to the SF Crime Data, the city experienced a 9% decrease in overall crime from 2018 to 2019. This trend continued into 2020, with an additional 12% decrease in overall crime compared to 2019. However, it is important to note that certain categories of crime have seen an increase during the pandemic, as illustrated in the previous figure.

One notable example is the category of "Vandalism," which saw a significant increase during the pandemic, with a 66.67% rise in average count compared to the 2018-2019 period. This trend may be linked to the various protests and demonstrations that occurred throughout the city during the pandemic, as individuals expressed their frustration with issues such as police brutality and social inequality.

Other categories that saw an increase in average count during the pandemic include "Burglary" (52.74%), "Motor Vehicle Theft" (40.01%), and "Arson" (37.01%). These increases may be attributed to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, which may have led some individuals to resort to criminal activity as a means of financial gain.

On the other hand, certain categories of crime saw a decrease during the pandemic. One example is the category of "Prostitution," which experienced a significant decline of 78.62% in average count compared to the 2018-2019 period. This trend may be linked to the various restrictions and shutdowns implemented during the pandemic, which may have made it more difficult for individuals involved in the sex trade to operate.

Overall, the impact of the pandemic on crime rates in San Francisco has been complex and multifaceted. While some categories of crime have seen an increase, others have seen a decrease. It is important for law enforcement officials and policymakers to continue monitoring these trends in order to develop effective strategies for promoting public safety in the city.
