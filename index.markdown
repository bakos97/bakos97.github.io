# Unveiling Gender Disparities: A Tale of Copenhagen and Denmark

Our journey takes us through bustling streets and serene landscapes as we unravel the narrative of gender disparities in income, parental leave, and education. This tale is multi-faceted, touching upon income, parental leave, and education.

## The Heart of the Matter: Income Disparities

This line chart presents a stark contrast in the income gap between genders in Copenhagen and the rest of Denmark over the years. Interestingly, the capital city appears to have a smaller income gap compared to the national average, though the gap has been slowly increasing in both areas over the years.

Next, we zoom into the districts within Denmark, examining the disparities at a more granular level.

This interactive plot reveals the stark disparities between male and female income across all districts in Denmark. Notice the pronounced gap in wealthier districts like Gentofte, Hørsholm, and Rudersdal. These areas, with their high average incomes, harbor larger gender pay gaps, hinting at a trend of higher income disparities in wealthier districts. As our analysis shows, income disparities between genders exist in Copenhagen as well as other parts of Denmark. This observation is echoed by general insights provided by [Denmark.dk](https://denmark.dk/society-and-business/gender-equality), which acknowledges the existence of a gender pay gap in Denmark despite the country's strong performance in gender equality. Moreover, the underrepresentation of women in top management positions, as highlighted by Denmark.dk, could potentially contribute to this wage gap, as such positions often command higher salaries.


### A Geographic Perspective: Visualizing Disparities Across Denmark

With the help of geographic visualization, we can get a clearer picture of how these disparities are distributed across Denmark.

This map plot illustrates the income gap across various regions in Denmark from 2009 to 2021. While the gap in some regions has remained relatively stable, in others it has fluctuated, indicating that gender income disparities are widespread and vary across regions.

The Next Steps
We've uncovered the income disparities between genders in Copenhagen and Denmark, but our journey is far from over. We now turn our attention towards the issue of parental leave. How does this key aspect of life contribute to the gender disparities we observe? Or should we delve into education, another critical facet of our society? Whichever path we choose, there's much more to uncover and understand.


## Parental Leave

![Development of gap in parental leave in Copenhagen compared to All Denmark](parental_gap_line_plot.png)

In the above graph we can see how over the years the gap is becoming bigger on average for all of Denmark compared to how Copenhagen is developing into a smaller gap in the recent years. For all of Denmark the gap was bigger in 2021 then it was in 2015 while in Copenhagen the gap is smaller in 2021 than it was in 2015. It is interesting that the gap seems to be getting bigger in all of Denmark, since over the recent years equality between genders have been a subject of a lot of conversations. This tells us that the equality in paternal leave in Copenhagen is better compared to all of Denmark and it's developing in the right direction, even though it's happening slowly.

Even though the parental leave in Denmark is quite good, the rights between men and women were not the same. Before, with children that are born before August 2022, women recieved paid leave for four weeks before the birth of a child and 14 weeks after. While men received paid leave for two weeks after the birth. Then the parents split up to 32 weeks of paid leave (https://denmark.dk/society-and-business/equality#:~:text=Did%20you%20know,to%2032%20weeks%20paid%20leave.).

But looking at the data it seems that this split of 32 weeks was mostly taken by the women. In the past it was very common for women to take most of the parental leave. Explanations given were often that it was the obvious choice since men were the ones that earn more and it would cost the household more to have the men on parental leave. But this has circulated back to women having a huge disadvantage on the job market, since they have been expected to go on a long leave when they have children, while that has not been the same for men.  

Now new rules have been accepted in Denmark for parental leave that took effect in August 2022. Where each parent has an earmarked 11 weeks for parental leave and these weeks cannot be shared between parents. But this is higher than the average has been for men ever in Copenhagen (https://www.thelocal.dk/20211026/denmark-agrees-new-rules-for-parental-leave). It will be very interesting to see how these numbers change since the new rules took place. 

To circle back to the income gap between the genders. The top three locations that had the highest income gaps (Hørsholm, Gentofte and Rudersdal) are ranking number 77, 97 and 100 on the list of areas sorted by parental leave gap. The three locations that had the lowest income gaps (Lolland, Bornholm and Langeland) are ranking number 109, 87 and 85 on that same list for parental leave gap. Which maybe does not tell us a lot, but from those numbers alone there does not seem to be correlation between the income gap and parental leave gap. But Lolland is doing well by being the location with the least gap in parental leave. 

Copenhagen is number 106 in the list of areas sorted by parental leave gap, in a list consisting of 109 locations. The following graph shows Copenhagen in comparison to all of Denmark and Ishøj, which was the highest ranking location, i.e. has the biggest gap.

Now we want to see if education could possibly correlate to the length of the parental leave. For that we're going to look at the fathers, their length of education and their average length of parental leave. The graph shows data from 2021.

Generally, fathers with higher levels of education tend to take longer parental leaves.

## Education

We will now conduct a detailed analysis of education, which can provide valuable insights into gender disparities in Copenhagen compared to the rest of Denmark. From 2005 to 2022, there has been a steady increase in the number of individuals pursuing higher education among both men and women. In this case, we are specifically examining the age group of 30 to 34 years that has completed their master’s degrees, which is usually the age where individuals have most likely attained their highest level of education before pursuing a Ph.D.

The rising number of men and women pursuing higher education indicates a growing emphasis on obtaining higher level of education throughout Denmark. However, a noteworthy observation is the widening gender gap in education, favoring women. This trend becomes especially noticeable when examining the percentages, despite the income gap favoring men. It is worth noting that the gender gap is slightly smaller in Copenhagen compared to the rest of Denmark.

Despite women acquiring higher levels of education than men, the income gap remains unchanging. This raises the question of why this disparity persists despite women's educational achievements surpassing those of men. To gain deeper understanding, we will examine the educational paths pursued by both men and women with the goal in mind is to uncover the mysteries behind the gender desparities.


![Education level comparison between genders and area in year 2005 and 2022](gender_education2.png)
Upon closer examination of these figures, it becomes evident that regardless of gender, there has been an increase of the amount of individuals seeking a higher levels of education in Denmark. The categories that had had a decrease were "H90 Not Stated" and "H10 Primary Education," which is a positive indication. More great news is that every education level above "H50" has seen a rise, indicating a growing trend of people seeking higher education in Denmark.

A significant differentiating factor is the "H20 Upper Secondary Education" for men, which has increased at the national level but decreased in Copenhagen. This suggests that men in Copenhagen are more inclined to pursue higher education compared to the rest of Denmark. This observation is in line with Copenhagen's prominent position as a frontrunner in terms of seeking higher education, as seen by the bar charts above "H50". This trend holds true for both men and women.

While there has been a general increase in education levels across the board, the growth is particularly interesting for women, with their numbers being numbers ahead of the men. As supported by previous figures, the number of men and women obtaining master's degrees was nearly equal in 2005. However, as the years progress, a notable shift takes place, leading to a significantly higher proportion of women outperforming men in this aspect.

Based on the findings presented in this article (https://politiken.dk/indland/uddannelse/art9287557/For-knap-40-%C3%A5r-siden-tog-lige-mange-m%C3%A6nd-og-kvinder-en-videreg%C3%A5ende-uddannelse.-Nu-har-kvinder-lagt-enorm-afstand-til-m%C3%A6ndene#:~:text=opretter%20en%20profil.-,Forskellen%20mellem%20andelen%20af%20kvinder%20og%20m%C3%A6nd%20med%20en%20videreg%C3%A5ende,nye%20tal%20fra%20Danmarks%20Statistik.) from Politiken, which is a well known broadsheet daily newspaper in Denmark, the gender disparity in higher education was less distinct four decades ago, with an equal number of men and women pursuing advanced degrees. However, the current situation shows a significant increase in the disparity, favoring women. The article further highlights the reasons behind the income gap, attributing it to factors such as women's tendency to choose fields with lower wages, such as humanities, while men often opt for higher-paying job revolving around science. Additionally, the article mentions that women tend to take more parental leave and work part-time more frequently compared to men, which is something we already have highlighted.
