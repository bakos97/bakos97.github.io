# COVID-19's Impact on San Francisco's Crime Rates: A Comprehensive Analysis

## How the Pandemic Affected Crime Patterns in San Francisco from 2018-2021

San Francisco, the city by the bay, is known for its vibrant culture, picturesque landscapes, and booming economy. However, like any major city, it has its fair share of crime. With the arrival of COVID-19, the pandemic has had a significant impact on the city, disrupting the status quo in almost every aspect of daily life. In this piece, we explore the fascinating world of crime in San Francisco during the pandemic and its effects on public safety in the city.

According to our analysis of the SF Crime Data, San Francisco witnessed over 133,262 reported incidents annually on average. Between 2018 and 2019, the city saw around 148,250 reported incidents per year, but this number dropped to around 118,273 in 2020 and 2021, representing a significant decline of nearly 20.22%.

Delving deeper into the data, we find that the pandemic has had an unequal impact on different categories of crime. Some types of crime decreased significantly, while others stubbornly remained high or even increased. The bar chart below illustrates the categories that saw the greatest changes in average count during the pandemic."

  <figcaption>This bar chart shows the incident categories with the greatest change in average count during the pandemic in San Francisco. The categories are ranked by percentage change, with the largest positive and negative changes at the top and bottom, respectively. The incident category "Civil Sidewalks" had the greatest negative change, with an average count decrease of 92.42% during the pandemic compared to the 2018-2019 period. The incident category "Vandalism" had the greatest positive change, with an average count increase of 66.67% during the pandemic compared to the 2018-2019 period.</figcaption>

Vandalism saw a massive increase of 66.67% during the pandemic, possibly due to the closure of public spaces and businesses, which may have left them more vulnerable to property damage. Burglary and motor vehicle theft also witnessed notable increases of over 40%.

In contrast, the pandemic had a significant positive impact on civil sidewalks, which witnessed a dramatic decrease of 92.42%. Meanwhile, prostitution, liquor laws, and gambling all witnessed a decrease of over 60%.
