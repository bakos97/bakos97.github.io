# COVID-19's Impact on San Francisco's Crime Rates: A Comprehensive Analysis

## How the Pandemic Affected Crime Patterns in San Francisco from 2018-2021

San Francisco, the city by the bay, is known for its vibrant culture, picturesque landscapes, and booming economy. However, like any major city, it has its fair share of crime. With the arrival of COVID-19, the pandemic has had a significant impact on the city, disrupting the status quo in almost every aspect of daily life. In this piece, we explore the fascinating world of crime in San Francisco during the pandemic and its effects on public safety in the city.

According to our analysis of the SF Crime Data, San Francisco witnessed over 133,262 reported incidents annually on average. Between 2018 and 2019, the city saw around 148,250 reported incidents per year, but this number dropped to around 118,273 in 2020 and 2021, representing a significant decline of nearly 20.22%.

Delving deeper into the data, we find that the pandemic has had an unequal impact on different categories of crime. Some types of crime decreased significantly, while others stubbornly remained high or even increased. The bar chart below illustrates the categories that saw the greatest changes in average count during the pandemic."

The incident category "Vandalism" had the greatest positive change, with an average count increase of 66.67% during the pandemic compared to the 2018-2019 period.</figcaption>

Vandalism saw a massive increase of 66.67% during the pandemic, possibly due to the closure of public spaces and businesses, which may have left them more vulnerable to property damage. Burglary and motor vehicle theft also witnessed notable increases of over 40%.

In contrast, the pandemic had a significant positive impact on civil sidewalks, which witnessed a dramatic decrease of 92.42%. Meanwhile, prostitution, liquor laws, and gambling all witnessed a decrease of over 60%.

But what about vandalism in San Francisco's different districts? We made a map to show you the number of vandalism incidents in each district during 2018-2019 and 2020-2021. The colors represent the number of incidents, with lighter colors indicating more incidents. Check it out below!

As you can see, there were increases in vandalism incidents in almost all districts during the pandemic. The central district saw the most significant increase, going from 23 incidents to 42 incidents. The northern district also had a significant increase, going from 28 incidents to 53 incidents. Richmond district saw a increase in vandalism incidents, going from 7 incidents to 16 incidents.

As we delved deeper into our analysis of San Francisco's crime patterns during the pandemic, we noticed a significant increase in vandalism. This increase in vandalism was perplexing to us, and we wanted to learn more about the phenomenon. We stumbled upon an article in the San Francisco Chronicle from April 2020, which shed some light on the issue.

The article reported that break-ins and instances of vandalism at restaurants were becoming increasingly common during the pandemic, as the Bay Area sheltered in place. While burglary rates were down by single digits in San Francisco compared to the same period the previous year, the combination of less-guarded businesses and unusually empty streets had created conditions for desperate people or opportunists to burglarize restaurants.

Mark Bechelli, the owner of Bechelli's Flower Market Cafe, discovered a busted window at his San Francisco restaurant about a week after the shelter-in-place order went into effect. Security footage revealed that a man had squeezed into the restaurant, swiped some liquor and quickly got out. Given the back-to-back break-ins, Bechelli reinforced the window with wood beams and hasn’t had a problem since. Both burglars stole liquor, leaving the back of the bar empty. Bechelli estimates losing $3,000 between the window and alcohol.

Similarly, Little Skillet, a San Francisco soul food spot, had long relied on takeout and remained open throughout the shelter-in-place order. On Saturday, owner Deanna Sison arrived to find the locks broken and valuables such as iPads, speakers, and cash gone.

As time went on, people became more and more desperate and took bigger and bigger risks, said Jay Foster, the former partner of Sison. He thought that restaurants that were still operating were bigger targets during the shutdown because they’re more likely to have cash and inventory.

This article confirms our finding that vandalism has increased during the pandemic in San Francisco, and offers insight into the reasons why. It also highlights the struggles of local businesses during this challenging time. We believe that by understanding the impact of the pandemic on crime in San Francisco, we can help support the community in moving forward.
