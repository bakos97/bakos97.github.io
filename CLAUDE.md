# CLAUDE.md - Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
Personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages at bakos97.github.io.
Targeted at recruiters and professional contacts.

## Tech Stack
- Static HTML/CSS/JS (no build step required)
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- No framework dependencies — vanilla front-end

## Structure
- `index.html` — Main portfolio landing page (hero, about, projects, skills, contact)
- `projects/gender-disparities.html` — Existing data analysis project page
- `css/style.css` — All styles
- `js/main.js` — Interactions and animations
- `assets/` — Images and other static assets
- `_config.yml` — GitHub Pages configuration

## Development
- Preview locally: open `index.html` in a browser, or use `python3 -m http.server`
- Deploy: push to `main` branch; GitHub Pages serves automatically
- No build tools, bundlers, or package managers needed

## Conventions
- Keep pages lightweight and fast-loading
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible markup (semantic HTML, alt text, sufficient contrast)
- All colors defined as CSS custom properties in `:root`
- Use BEM-like class naming in CSS

## Content Placeholders
Sections marked with `<!-- PLACEHOLDER -->` need the owner's real information filled in.
Search for "PLACEHOLDER" to find all spots that need personalization.
